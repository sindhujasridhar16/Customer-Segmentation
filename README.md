# Customer Segmentation Analysis


RFM stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Value. It is a method used by businesses to analyze customer behavior and segment customers based on their purchasing patterns. Here's a breakdown of each component:

Recency (R): This refers to how recently a customer has made a purchase. Customers who have made a purchase more recently are often considered more valuable because they are likely to be more engaged with the brand and more likely to make future purchases.

Frequency (F): This refers to how often a customer makes purchases. Customers who make frequent purchases are often considered more loyal and valuable to the business.

Monetary Value (M): This refers to the monetary value of a customer's purchases. Customers who spend more money on each purchase are often considered more valuable because they contribute more revenue to the business.

By analyzing these three factors together, businesses can segment their customers into different groups based on their overall value to the business. This allows businesses to better understand their customers, tailor their marketing efforts to specific customer segments, and ultimately improve customer satisfaction and loyalty. RFM analysis can be conducted using customer transaction data and is often used in combination with other customer segmentation techniques to provide deeper insights into customer behavior.
